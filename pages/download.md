<h1 class="no-margin-top">A lightweight REST API library</h1>

Javalin is a true microframework with only one required dependency: SLF4J (logging).
By default Javalin also depends on Jetty, but you can exclude 
if you want to use a different Webserver (like Tomcat, etc).
Javalin also has plugins for JSON mapping, template rendering, and OpenAPI (Swagger), but they're
optional dependencies that you have to add manually.
See the [plugins](/plugins) page for more information.
